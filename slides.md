## Introduction

> A design pattern is the re-usable form of a solution to a design problem. The idea was introduced by the architect Christopher Alexander and has been adapted for various other disciplines, most notably "computer science".

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern

???
Q: What do you know about design patterns?

A: It's about his experience in solving *design issues* and how they related to buildings and towns.

In collaboration with Sara Ishikawa and Murray Silverstein, Alexander produced a pattern language that would help empower anyone wishing to design and build at any scale. This was published back in 1977 in a paper titled “A Pattern Language,” which was later released as a complete hardcover book.

---

## Software design pattern

In software engineering, a software design pattern is

* a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design
* It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern

???
Some 30 years ago, software engineers began to incorporate the principles Alexander had written about into the first documentation about design patterns, which was to be a guide for novice developers looking to improve their coding skills.

* It is **not** a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code.
* Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

What is the first time I heard about design patterns?

GOF 四人帮

Now we've got the definition of What a software design patterns are, do you know anyone of them?

Enough about concept, let's check some common patterns we already know and used everyday.

## We Already Use Patterns Every Day

Object oriented programming

```JavaScript
class Conference {
  constructor(name, location, year) {
    this.name = name
    this.location = location
    this.year = year
  }

  sayHi() {
    console.log(`欢迎来到${this.year} ${this.location} ${this.name}.`)
  }
}

const ningjs = new Conference('JavaScritp中国开发者大会', '南京', '2016年')

ningjs.sayHi()
// 欢迎来到2016年 南京 JavaScritp中国开发者大会.
```

---

### With jQuery

DOM Traversal and Manipulation

```JavaScript
$( "button.continue" ).html( "Next Step..." )
```

Event Handling

```JavaScript
var hiddenBox = $( "#banner-message" );
$( "#button-container button" ).on( "click", function( event ) {
  hiddenBox.show();
});
```

## MV* Patterns

> Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces on computers. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.

MVC (Model-View-Controller)

MVP (Model-View-Presenter)

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

Backbone.js, Angular.js, Knockout.js

Single page app getting popular, what are the popular ones?

Enough about history, let's go back to the modern world.

---

### Design patterns popular in the current frontend framework world

* Functional programming
* Declarative and functional view rendering
* Unidirectional data flow
* Immutable data structure
* Type system

---

## Functional style programming

> Functional programming is about writing pure functions, about removing hidden inputs and outputs as far as we can, so that as much of our code as possible just describes a relationship between inputs and outputs.

**Pure functions without any side effect**

**First-class and higher-order functions**

source: http://blog.jenkster.com/2015/12/what-is-functional-programming.html

???
What is functional programming?

Functional Programming (FP) is not a new concept by any means. It's been around almost as long as any programming has been around.

Oh wait, What is pure function? what is side effect?

---
class: center, middle

![pattern](images/function.jpeg)

---

### Pure function

> A pure function is a function where the **return value** is **only determined** by its **input values**, without observable side effects. This is how functions in math work: Math.cos(x) will, for the same value of x , always return the same result. Computing it does not change x

???
Example of non-pure function and pure function

---

### Not pure function

Given same input, the return value is different, not pure.

```JavaScript
let name = 'jsconf china'
function greeting () {
  // bad things could happen
  return 'Welcome to ' + name + '.'
}

function updateName () {
  name = 'phpconf china'
}

// accidentally called updateName()
updateName()

// if name updates, the function return different result
greeting()
// 'Welcome to phpconf china.'
```

**Hard to test.**

---

### Pure function

Given same input, always return same value.

```JavaScript
const name = 'jsconf china'
function greeting (name) {
  return 'Welcome to ' + name
}

// alwasy return the same result
greeting(name)
```

**Easy to test.**

---

### Test pure function

```JavaScript
const test = require('tape')

function greeting (name) {
  return 'Welcome to ' + name
}

test('greeting function', function (assert) {
  const expect = greeting('jsconf china')
  const actual = 'Welcome to jsconf china'

  assert.equal(expect, actual, 'should greeting to me.')
  assert.end()
})
```

---

### High order function

> a function that does at least one of the following: takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e., procedural parameters), returns a function as its result.

```JavaScript
function year (year) {
  // return a new function
  return function city (city) {
    console.log(`Welcome to ${year} JSConf China in ${city}.`)
  }
}

// time is a function
const time = year(2016)
// we can call time function
time('Nanjing')

// or
year(2016)('Nanjing')
// 'Welcome to 2016 JSConf China in Nanjing.'
```

???
How does this related to building user interface?

---

### Declarative and functional view rendering

Declarative rendering, view is a presentation of a state.

```elm
view : Model -> Html
view model = Html
```

* No side effect, return same HTML given same state
* Stateless/pure component, easy to test
* High order component, make composition easy
* Separate concern between UI view and other business logic
* Make it easy to target multiple different platforms

---

### In [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

```JavaScript
const HelloMessage = (props) => <div>Hello {props.name}</div>;
ReactDOM.render(<HelloMessage name="JSConf China" />, mountNode);
```

---

### In [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

```JavaScript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { AppRegistry, Text, View } from 'react-native'

class HelloComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    const { name } = this.props
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>
          Hello {name}
        </Text>
      <View>
    );
  }
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloComponent', () => HelloComponent)
```

---

### In [yo-yo](https://github.com/maxogden/yo-yo)

> A tiny library for building modular UI components using DOM diffing and ES6 tagged template literals

```js
const yo = require('yo-yo')

const HelloMessage = (props) => {
  return yo`<div>hello ${props.name}!</div>`
}
const element = HelloMessage({
  name: 'JSConf China'
})

document.body.appendChild(element)
```

---

### In [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

```elm
import Html exposing (div, text)
import Html.Attributes exposing (class)


model = {
  name = "JSConf China"
}


main model =
  div [class "welcome-message"] [text ("Hello, " ++ model.name)]
```

???
Things started to out of control.

### With [Elm](elm-lang.org)

A delightful language for reliable webapps.

Generate JavaScript with great performance and no runtime exceptions.

* Model — the state of your application
* Update — a way to update your state
* View — a way to view your state as HTML

Note: ^ is from [The Elm Architecture](http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/index.html)

---

### Code example with Elm

```elm
import Html exposing (div, button, text)
import Html.App exposing (beginnerProgram)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)


main =
  beginnerProgram { model = 0, view = view, update = update }


view model =
  div []
    [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text "-" ]
    , div [] [ text (toString model) ]
    , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
    ]


type Msg = Increment | Decrement


update msg model =
  case msg of
    Increment ->
      model + 1

    Decrement ->
      model - 1

```

???
When you are confused of the api design of Redux, go and check out the Elm architecture, it really helps.

---

### Immutable data structure

* Predictability
* Performance
* Mutation Tracking

???

Mutation hides change, which create (unexpected) side effects, which can cause nasty bugs. When you enforce immutability you can keep your application architecture and mental model simple, which makes it easier to reason about your application.

Even though adding values to an immutable Object means that a new instance needs to be created where existing values need to be copied and new values need to be added to the new Object which cost memory. Immutable Objects can make use of structural sharing to reduce memory overhead.

Besides reduced memory usage, immutability allows you to optimize your application by making use of reference- and value equality. This makes it really easy to see if anything has changed. For example a state change in a react component. You can use shouldComponentUpdate to check if the state is identical by comparing state Objects and prevent unnecessary rendering. You can read more about this here.

---

### Immutable.js

```JavaScript
var Immutable = require('immutable')

var map = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 })

map
  .set('b', 50)
  .get('b') // 50

var list = Immutable.List.of(1, 2)

list
  .push(3, 4, 5)
  .unshift(0)
  .concat(list2, list3)
  .get(0)
  .size
```

---

### Elm lang

```elm
model =
  {name = "JSConf China"
  , location = "Shenzhen"
  }

newModel =
  {model | location = "Nanjing"}

```

---

### How to not mutate with "native" JavaScript

--
* `Array.map()` over `Array.forEach()` when iterating
--

* `Array.filter()` over `Array.forEach()` when filtering
--

* `[...items, newItem]` or `Array.concat()` over `Array.push()` when updating array
--

* `Object.assign({}, myObj, { name: 'fraserxu'})` or `Array.reduce()` over `myObj.name = 'fraserxu'` when updating object
--


[Mutator method in JavaScript Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Mutator_methods)

---

### Immutable JavaScript resources

* mori from the ClojureScript community
* ramdajs
* Immutable.js in JavaScript
* seamless-immutable
* native support in Elm!

---

### Type system

Improve reliability of complex system, 0 run time error.

```JavaScript
function toLower (str) {
  return str.toLowerCase()
}

toLower("YO")
// "yo"
toLower(123)
// Uncaught TypeError: str.toLowerCase is not a function(…)
```

---

### Cool kids

* Flow
* TypeScript
* ClojureScript
* Elm

---

### Example with Flow type

```JavaSCript
/* @flow */

function toLower (str) {
  return str.toLowerCase()
}

toLower("YO")
toLower(123)

// or

function toLower(str) : string {
  return str.toLowerCase()
}

toLower(123)
```

---

### Example with Elm lang

![elm](http://elm-lang.org/assets/blog/error-messages/0.16/string-hint.png)

???
Unlike hand-written JavaScript, Elm code does not produce runtime exceptions in practice. Instead, Elm uses type inference to detect problems during compilation and give friendly hints. This way problems never make it to your users. NoRedInk has 36k lines of Elm, and after more than a year in production, it still has not produced a single runtime exception.

---

### Type Aannotations in Elm

```elm
answer : Int
answer =
  42

factorial : Int -> Int
factorial n =
  List.product [1..n]

distance : { x : Float, y : Float } -> Float
distance {x,y} =
  sqrt (x^2 + y^2)
```

---

### Type Aliases

```elm
type alias Name = String
type alias Age = Int

info : (Name,Age)
info =
  ("Steve", 28)

type alias Point = { x:Float, y:Float }

origin : Point
origin =
  { x = 0, y = 0 }
```

### JavaScript is not a perfect language(at all).

* Functional style programming
* Declarative and functional view rendering
* Unidirectional data flow
* Immutable data structure
* Type system
